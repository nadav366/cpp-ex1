The software consists of two objects -
Object field which is a number field. It contains its field base and exponent.
Object that is a number in a field containing a field and the number value.

Field class:
    The class can return all the information about the field.
    Check if a number is prime.
    Find a maximum common divisor for two numbers.
    Create a new number in the field.

Numbering class -
    The class can return all the information about the number.
    Return the number to primary entities and print them out.
    Check if the number is prime.

*************************************************
Exercise Details-

Using familiar algorithms-
Software Execution Use three familiar algorithms:
    * Euclid's algorithm for finding a maximum common divisor for two numbers.
    * Experimental and wonder algorithm for Direct Search Factorization.
    * rho Pollard's algorithm for finding a number factor

More exercise details-
    * Exercising a variety of operators for each object, helping to perform different
        actions on the objects (such as realizing all algorithms)
    * Using private methods to not allow a user of a header file to use auxiliary functions
        directly
